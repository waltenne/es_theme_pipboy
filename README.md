Emulationstation / Retropie Theme based on Fallout

This theme has been developed, through many research and ideas obtained as much as in the official forum of retropie and in facebook groups The idea of this theme is something cleaner, without much information. I kept on the game selection screen only the cover of the game, the preview in video and selection list

At first, this topic was a test on my part, I used several guides on the internet to build it. As I saw that something was really cool, I made my image on raspberry pi using this theme and among other modifications

The theme has been tested only on a 32-inch monitor, for other resolutions, it may have some kind of bug This end result was after some research ideas and also suggestions by the community

Link to a previous video of how my system customized in this theme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F03U_JcM-L4

I thank everyone. If you have any suggestions for improvement, I thank you

This theme is free if you want to help me or encourage me to continue. https://ko-fi.com/wcarvalho
